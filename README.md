# swgoh-essential-sheet
The SWGoH Essential Sheet is a Google Sheets Library that utilizes Comlink to retrieve data directly from the Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes mobile game and store it directly in the sheet. It provides game data, guild data, and player data including guild event tracking, daily raid tickets, base stats at each gear level for characters, gear recipes and relic recipes, and much more. It can be translated into all the same languages the game itself can and allows for renaming the tabs. It is provided as a library so it can be inserted into any project you currently have or the official sheet can be copied.
